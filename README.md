# Lissotriton_RADseq_Y

This repository contains the scripts written to identify and analyse the Y-chromosome of _Lissotriton vulgaris_ from raw RADseq data.  

This project includes two main arms:  
Firstly, identification of Y-linked markers from RADseq data derived from adults of know sex.  
Secondly, construction and analysis of a linkage map based on RADseq data from full-sibling embryos of unkown sex.  

For both arms of the project this repository contains a detailed markdown document, describing all steps need to generate the final outputs from the raw data. This includes one-liner shell commands, plus the use of relevant R and Perl scripts, and a list of the dependencies.  

In addition to the scripts relevant data files are also included.
